# Html / Css refactor 

## Description 
This repository is my attempt at applying best practice formatting on to the CSS and HTML of provided starter code. This includes replacing relevant "div" tags with semantic tags, adding alt descriptions of the images, and overall cleaning up the code so it is more streamlined and easier to read.

This is ideal practice to allow me to show my understanding of basic css and HTML formatting.

## Installation

No installation required. 

## Usage 

The main use for this is to show that the outputted page is the same but the background code in html and CSS is adjusted to be clearer and more succinct. As you can see from the below screenshot, it is identical to the picture in the assignment requirements.
